## [DOHyUNG](https://github.com/OlliStudio/DOHyUNG-Java)
This repo is a simple version of [this repo](https://github.com/OlliStudio/DOHyUNG-Java).  
The repo is more complex (it uses custom classes, and S-DOHyUNG uses int)  
**So, we assume that all dividing and subtracting will give exact 'int' values, if it is divided wrong, it might be because of the simple system.**
